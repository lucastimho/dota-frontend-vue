    <h1>About This Database</h1>
    <p>
      Well I made this database for a project for Actualize. There was a lot of issues making this come together but I'm
      glad I stuck through with it. I used an API to get me all the data that find on this application. I really enjoy
      playing Dota 2 and that's what I pursued making this database. Would I use this personally. Honestly no, because
      I'm not that interested in following players. That does not mean I'm not proud of my work though, I throughly
      enjoyed working on every piece of code despite all the headaches (ugh). Anyways thank you for checking out this
      application and for reading this page. Now go back and look through this application some more!
