              Well I made this database for a project for Actualize. There was a lot of issues making this come together
              but I'm glad I stuck through with it. I used an API to get me all the data that you find on this
              application. I really enjoy playing Dota 2 and that's why I pursued making this database. Would I use this
              personally. Honestly no, because I'm not that interested in following players. That does not mean I'm not
              proud of my work though, I throughly enjoyed working on every piece of code despite all the headaches
              (ugh). Anyways, thank you for checking out this application and for reading this page. Now go back and
              look through this application some more!
