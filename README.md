# About the Project

![dota_frontpage.png](/frontpage.png)
Welcome to my frontend application to one of my favorite online games, Dota 2. I developed this application in inspiration of the website [Dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/). On that website, users are able to find information about players and matches being played on dota. As I used this website myself, I noticed that the website didn't have a feature to follow a user's favorite professional Dota 2 players. This propelled me to create this application as well try to implement as many elements of the Dotabuff website that I was able to recreate.

### Built With
